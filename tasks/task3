Create a function which checks a number for three different
requirements:
● the number is prime
● the number is even
● the number is a multiple of 10
Each should return either true or false, which should be given as an array.
The number will always be an integer, either positive or negative. Note that
negative numbers cannot be primes, but they can be multiples of 10.
checkNumber(7) // ---> [true, false, false]
checkNumber(-10) // ---> [false, true, true]

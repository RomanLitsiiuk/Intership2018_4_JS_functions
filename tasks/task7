The new "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" movie has just been released!
There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line.
Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. A "Batman v Superman:
Dawn of Justice" ticket costs 25 dollars. Vasya is currently working as a clerk.
He wants to cell a ticket to every single person in this line. Can Vasya
sell a ticket to each person and give the charge if he initially has no money and
sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?
Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change.
Otherwise return NO. Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change?

Examples:
tickets([25, 25, 50]) // YES
tickets([25, 100]) // NO
tickets([25, 25, 50, 100]) // YES
tickets([25, 50, 100]) // NO
